      <p> The idea to produce skincare products using coffee ground was born last year. When Jo found out that microbeads used in many cosmetic products are endangering marine wildlife, she realised that coffee ground could be used as an eco-friendly alternative. Recycling coffee ground to make skincare products could potentially tackle the issue of food waste, too. In the UK, tonnes of coffee ground are produced each year. Remarkably, nutrients contained in your coffee remain intact after you finish your cup. And coffee ground is just as great for exfoliating your skin as the microbeads, plus it’s organic and causes no damage to the environment! So, we came up with an idea of a product that was both cost effective and eco-friendly. We decided to make scrubs and scented candles based on coffee ground - a range of skincare goods for true coffee lovers – and called it HopeEspress. </p>

      <p>Over the summer, Jo and Abigail tried out different recipes for coffee scrubs and candles that they found online. Since then they’ve been trying to elucidate an original method to create a range of scrubs that is suitable for all skin types. They’ve also been looking for ways to make long-lasting candles with various aromas. Right now our product development team is working to perfect the methods and expand the range of products on offer. </p>

      <p>The coffee ground we use in our products comes from local coffee shops. We check that all our ingredients are organic and wholesome. We only get coffee ground used to make fair trade coffee. We believe that everyone deserves the access to high quality products. That’s why our goal is to produce hand-made organic skincare products that are affordable to anyone. Our coffee sugar scrub and the candles are just the start. Ideally we are aiming to create a whole bath experience – look out for new products in future! </p>

      <p> Abigail came to find out about the problems faced by single parents at her home in Malaysia, when one of the family friends passed away, leaving his wife and children without regular income. Single mum faced many challenges because it was time for her children to start high school and go to university, but she wasn’t qualified enough to take up a high-paid job. Abigail empathised with single parents and found an opportunity to help them through HopeEspress project. </p>

      <p> Abigail contacted different organisations to find single parents who would be interested to take part in our project. Alessandra reached out in response to the newsletter Gingerbread organisation sent out. Alessandra and her friend Vera, who had worked in the beauty and spa industry, have been testing the products we’ve made so far and gave us feedback on the quality of scrubs and candles. As soon as we finalise the production method, we will teach more single parents how to make scrubs and candles at home using the ingredients we provide. That will be an additional form of income and a flexible job, since they can look after their children while preparing the products. We also plan to deliver workshops in accounting skills, marketing, and networking for them. Jo and Abigail will hold the workshops with assistance from Imperial College Business School students. In the end, our goal is to empower single parents by presenting these opportunities to develop their skills, which they could use no matter if they want to stay in our project or continue as full-time employees with other businesses. </p>
