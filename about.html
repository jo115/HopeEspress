      <p>Hope Espress is a brand developed by a team of students who are passionate about making a positive impact in local community through entrepreneurial action. We launched our project in response to the issue of food waste. Our goal is to develop a range of sustainable beauty products by recycling coffee ground from cafes. </p>
      <p> We create high quality, hand-crafted, cruelty-free coffee sugar scrub and scented candles in a range of aromas. HopeEspress also aims to empower single parents by providing them with a part-time job in product development and organising business and marketing workshops. Treat yourself to an unforgettable spa experience with a variety of beauty products on offer. </p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>The coffee ground we use in our products comes from local coffee shops. We check that all our ingredients are organic and wholesome. We only get coffee ground used to make fair trade coffee. We believe that everyone deserves the access to high quality products. That’s why our goal is to produce hand-made organic skincare products that are affordable to anyone. Our coffee sugar scrub and the candles are just the start. Ideally we are aiming to create a whole bath experience – look out for new products in future!</p>
